## Research Span <span id="research-span"></span>

I conduct research within the span of *philosophy* <img src="/assets/images/otimes.png" width="13"> *mathematics* <img src="/assets/images/otimes.png" width="13"> *physics* <img src="/assets/images/otimes.png" width="13"> *computing* with an ultimate goal of creating autonomous and scalable computational multi-physics analysis and design toolkits by synthesizing techniques from the following subject areas:

| Area | Purpose |
|---|---|
Flexible Multibody Dynamics and Computational Fluid Mechanics | laws concerning the behavior of solids and fluids under forces |
Uncertainty Quantification and Statistical Inference | theory to incorporate statistics into deterministic computational methods |
Design Optimization Under Uncertainty | field of optimization that is foundational to accommodate randomness for improving design robustness and reliability |
Adjoint and Tangent Sensitivity Analysis | scalable methods for obtaining analytical derivatives for design optimization |
Multi-Fidelity Surrogate Modelling | theoretical methods for data interpolation/regression and the augmention of higher-order information |
Software Architecture and High Performance Computing | structure and organization of computational modules and handling their complex interactions among themselves and the computer hardware|

### Experimental Concepts:

**Caution**: the following are highly exploratory and may be impractical or useless. However, I do see strong analogies with established technical methods and find them worthy of investigation.
 
| Area | Purpose |  
|---|---|
Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence | hosts the implementation of computational algorithms, handle inter-node communications, on- and off-chain data storage, and achieve automation |
